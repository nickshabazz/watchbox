# Nick Shabazz Modular Watchbox 

This OpenSCAD file allows you to create modular watch boxes which stack nicely, just by modifying the parameters. So to make one which is extra tall (e.g. for a lower level or taller watches), raise the comptartmentDepth figure. To add a layer for knives, change number of rows and columns to get more, thinner slots. To make a drawer without dividers, change 'innerDepth' to 0. And so forth. Enjoy!
